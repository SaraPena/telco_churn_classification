# telco_churn_classification

#### Why do telco customers churn?

You will need:
1. you personal env.py file with username, password, and host info to access MySQL where telco_churn database lives.
2. acquire.py
3. prepare.py
4. model.py

#### Create a project to answer the following questions:

Could the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers))

Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?

Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?

If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?


#### Deliverables:

1. A report (ipynb) answering the question, "Why are our customers churning?". Include analysis you did to answer questions and lead to your findings.  

2. A csv with the customer_id, probability of churn, and the prediction of churn (1=churn, 0=not_churn).

3. 1-3  slides (+ title) that illustrates how your model works, including the features being used,
